# Safe-Home

## About 

Most of us in our life time will at one stage or another move house at least once for various reasons. Some move house to be within a school catchment area, others move house to upgrade the size of their house but everyone who moves houses wants to be in a safe location for their family.

Safe Home is an application which not only allows you to utilize one of the markets leading real estate portfolios on your search for a home, but also view data from local UK police forces on the safest areas to live. Choose Safe Home to move house with the confidence that you have the best option on the market and the safest area to enjoy life. 

## Concept

Safe Home is an application that aims to make the search for a house easy and ensure users that their new home is in a safe area. By bringing together different sources of data such as the zoopla API,Google Maps API and UK Police API the application offers a comprehensive overview of what houses are available and whether or not they are in an area with a lot of crime. 

The application has a distinct use case, but appeals to many different types of users. We wanted to create a solution that can be accessible to everyone. New families who want to buy a new home, reformed convicted criminals who want to avoid a crime heavy area and real estate investors who want to track crime levels before investing to name a few of the wide use cases for the app. 


## User Story

1. A user navigates for safehome.co.uk and enters the location that they would like to search for houses in. 

2. The user then gets a page full of houses available within the area they searched, which is powered by Zoopla API.

3. After browsing the available houses in the location, the user selects a house that they like. are taken to a page that displays pictures of the property and a description. There is also a direct link to zoopla 

4. To find out about the levels of crime within the local area, the user navigates to the crime page, which has an image of a map that is highlighted with the major crime spots. The areas with the most crime presence are highlighted by a larger red circle than those with less crime. 

5. If the user is happy with both the location of the house and the levels of crime in the area they can proceed to enquire about the property on Zoopla. The Safe Home application has successfully aided the house buying process.
